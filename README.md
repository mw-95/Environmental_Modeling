# Environmental_Modeling

GEE and R scripts for modeling the circumantarctic prevalence of humpback whales during feeding season.

Raster datasets of the relevant environmental predictors were created and reprojected to a circumantarctic projection using Google Earth Engine.
The models (BRT and Maxent) were then run with the R script.

Both scripts were written by me for the Spatial Distribution Modeling course of the EAGLE M.Sc. at Uni WÃ¼rzburg.
